                 <br> While playing RuneScape you might experience a strange, unexpected event, or notice something peculiar taking place nearby. These random events will typically involve the sudden appearance of an unusual animal or person, who will ask you to perform a quick task for them or solve a puzzle. Completing the event won't take long, and if you're lucky you may well profit from it! Make sure you keep your wits about you, though, because random events can happen at almost any time and in almost any place.

                 <br> Random events will teleport you to unusual locations that may or may not be a part of RuneScape itself. You will not be able to leave until you either successfully complete the random event, or fail in the attempt. If you successfully complete the random event you will be returned to the spot you were taken from; if you fail, you will be teleported to a random location. Don't worry too much about failing an event, though: you will never be teleported to a dangerous location. 
                 <br>
                 <br> Random events will occur with a certain degree of regularity, but if you consistently complete events successfully, you will encounter them less frequently.

                 <br> Whenever you successfully complete a random event, you will be given a random event gift box. (The only exception to this is the Maze event.) Inside the box will be a selection of items, from which you can choose one reward. Gift boxes will always contain a selection of coins, runes, coal, essence, ore, bars, gems, herbs, seeds, charms and experience lamps for you to choose from. In addition to this, some gift boxes will give you the choice of costume points, which can be exchanged for part of an outfit with Iffie at Thessalia's clothes shop in Varrock.

                 <br> Some random events are no longer active, which in most cases is because the person (or creature) responsible was considered to no longer be up to the job. Most of the guardians, for example, now spend their days in the Enchanted Valley (which you can get to using the fairy rings), while some of the more unsavoury types, like Cap'n Hand, reside in Port Sarim jail. You'll still see Dr Jekyll from time to time, dashing to the Varrock apothecary in a desperate bid to keep Mr Hyde in check; and if you're in Karamja to the south-west of Brimhaven, you may come across the strange plant, which still produces rather excellent fruit. The Drunken Dwarf will also be seen on occasion, staggering about in an erratic fashion. If you talk to him, and he takes a liking to you, he might treat you to a kebab and some beer.
